The seats (sofa in my case) is fin, not too soft and not too hard, the lights aren’t too bright nor too dim, the air quality (although I’m certainly not an expert on this) is supreme. The noise was somewhat distracting during the other students’ lecture break. I also noticed opening my tin can was awkwardly loud, although that lasted for a mere millisecond.   \n",
